# VASH

Voice Activated SHell (VASH) is a command line for your digital voice assistant. Current development has a focus on useful tools for restaurants, such as displaying the name
of a customer on a screen (/orderfor) or taking recipe notes. Further development will allow for creating, accessing, and scaling recipes.
